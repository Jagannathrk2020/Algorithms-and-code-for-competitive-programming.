## Extended Euclidean Algorithm

Extended Euclidean Algorithm finds integer coefficients x and y such that:
    ax + by = gdc(a, b)

if you have the following equation:

    ax + by = c

    Then:
    
    1) if c == gcd(a, b), you have a direct answer
    2) if c % gcd(a, b) == 0, you can easily obtain the answer
    3) else, there is no possible answer.
