#Geometry

Dot product:
  The dot product of two vectors u and v is a real number determined by:
    #u ⋅ v = |v||u|cos θ, 0 π ≤ θ ≤ , θ it's the angle between u e v.
  
  Properties 

  1) u ⋅ v = 0, if, and only if, one of them is null or θ = 90
  2) u ⋅ v ==  v ⋅ u
  3) u ⋅ u = |u|² 
  4) if  m and  n are real numbers: mu ⋅ nv = mn (u ⋅ v)
  5) (v + u) ⋅ w == (w ⋅ v) + (w ⋅ u)
  6) The dot product can tell us if the vector are at the same direction (u.v > 0)
  
Cross product:
  The cross product of two vectors u and v it's a vector determined by :
     #w = u x v = |u||v|sin θ, 0 π ≤ θ ≤ , θ it's the angle between u e v.
  
  Properties
 
  1) The vector w is normal to both v and u (and the plain that contains them)
  2) The absolute value of w can tell us the relative position of these vectors (clockwise if > 0)
  3) The absolut value of w is also the is equal to the area of the parallelogram with two of its sides formed by A and B. Furthermore, the triangle formed by A, B and the red line in the diagram has half of the area of the parallelogram, so we can calculate its area from the cross product also.
  4) u x v = 0, if, and only if, one of them is null or θ = 0 
  2) u x v = - (v x u)
  3) mv x nu = (mn) (v x u), if  m and  n are real numbers
  4) Distributive
  5) u = (x1,y1) and v = (x2,y2), u x v = x1*y2 - y1*x2
